# 🚀 Agentic AI for Personalized Course Pathways (IBM Internship Project)

This project was built as part of the **IBM AICTE Internship 2025**. It focuses on creating an **Agentic AI system** using **IBM Watsonx.ai**, capable of generating personalized learning roadmaps for students in various technical domains such as Web Development, Cybersecurity, and Machine Learning.

## 🧠 Project Objective
To develop a virtual AI mentor named **LearnMate** that:
- Interacts with users via natural language
- Understands their skill levels, goals, and available learning time
- Generates a structured, weekly course roadmap that adapts over time

## 🏗️ Technologies Used
- **IBM Watsonx.ai Agent Lab**
- **LangGraph** framework
- **ReAct Architecture** (Reasoning + Acting)
- **LLaMA-3-70B-Instruct** model
- **Prompt Engineering**
- Integrated tools: Google, DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia

## 📥 Inputs
The AI agent takes in the following:
- User’s domain of interest (e.g., Data Science, Web Dev)
- Skill level (Beginner, Intermediate)
- Career goal (Freelance, Internship, Job-ready)
- Time availability (e.g., 3 months, 2 hrs/day)

## 📤 Outputs
- Weekly course roadmap tailored to the user
- Adaptable learning plans based on skill progression
- Integration of real-time info via search tools
- Scalable and reusable across education domains

## 📸 Sample Screenshots
Screenshots of the agent setup and execution can be found in the [`/screenshots`](./screenshots) folder.

## 📂 Folder Overview
- `prompts/`: Finalized agent prompt templates
- `roadmap_samples/`: Example output files
- `screenshots/`: Screenshots from IBM Agent Lab interface

## 📊 Results
| Query | Domain          | Goal           | Output Match (%) |
|-------|------------------|----------------|------------------|
| Q1    | Data Science     | Internship     | 94%              |
| Q2    | Web Development  | Freelancing    | 92%              |
| Q3    | Cybersecurity    | Certification  | 91%              |

## 🔮 Future Scope
- API integration from platforms like Coursera/Udemy
- Resume and GitHub profile analysis
- Multilingual roadmap generation
- Deployment as a web app or mobile assistant

## 🤝 Acknowledgements
Special thanks to **IBM AICTE Virtual Internship Team** and mentors for guidance and resources.
